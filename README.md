### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**FRTNX/FRTNX** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:


-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on `zorb`, a data science utility that, well, absorbs data.
- ðŸŒ± This is in concert with an in-depth study of machine learning and autonomous agents, both with and without libararies that handle model generation.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any cool project with high impact.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with transitioning into space tech. And funding my tech startup Zugzwang.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about well-known and obscure historical wars, battles, and generals. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: frtnx@protonmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Him/Them
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy Zen meditation, Tai Chi, wushu, trail biking, outdoor running, and reading like an overgrown bookworm :)
